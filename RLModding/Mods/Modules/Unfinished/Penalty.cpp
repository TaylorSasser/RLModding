1. Choose random team to take shots first
2. Players not kicking or defending will be removed from the game and can spectate
3. Ball will be placed some distance from the goal centered (IRL it is 11m from the goal line).  The goalkeeper must stay between the posts until the ball is kicked.
4. Since the players cannot choose the order, the order will be random.
5. Each player can hit the ball only once per attempt. Once hit, the player may not play the ball again.
6. No other player on either team, other than the designated kicker and goalkeeper, may touch the ball.
7. A kick is successful if, having been touched once by the kicker, the ball crosses the goal line between the goal posts and under the crossbar, without touching any player, official, or outside agent other than the defending goalkeeper. The ball may touch the goalkeeper, goal posts, or crossbar any number of times before going into the goal as long as the referee believes the ball's motion is the result of the initial kick.
8. Teams take turns to kick from the penalty mark until each has taken five kicks. However, if one side has scored more successful kicks than the other could possibly reach with all of its remaining kicks, the shoot-out immediately ends regardless of the number of kicks remaining; this basis is called "best of five kicks".
9. If at the end of these five rounds of kicks the teams have scored an equal number of successful kicks, additional rounds of one kick each will be used until the tie is broken; this is known as sudden death.
10. The team that scores the most successful kicks at the end of the shoot-out will be the winner of the match.
11. Only players who were on the pitch at the end of play will be allowed to participate in the shoot-out.

Other Default Rules
A team may replace a goalkeeper who becomes injured during the shoot-out with a substitute (provided the team has not already used the maximum number of substitutes allowed by the competition) or by a player previously excluded under the 'reduce to equate' provision.[1]
May need to have a time limit after the kick to count it
Any player remaining on the pitch may act as the goalkeeper, and it is not required for the same player to have acted as a goalkeeper during the game.
No player will be allowed to take a second kick until all other eligible players on their team have taken a first kick, including the goalkeeper.
If it becomes necessary for players to take another kick (because the score has remained equal after all eligible players have taken their first kick), players are not required to kick in the same order.
